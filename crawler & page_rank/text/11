currently stand by ethan marcotte nicole zhu nicole fenton ryan gantz ambika castle livia labate and kat windley jul pm edt share this story share this on facebook share this on twitter share this on reddit share all sharing options share all sharing options for update on accessibility improvements we re making to chorus linkedin reddit flipboard pocket email as l via labate recently wrote an accessible website is a website that anyone can use however they need to that s an ideal we care deeply about here at vox media but we haven t been prioritizing it as much as we should have over the last few months we ve been changing that the product team s been hard at work improving the accessibility of chorus and every website powered by it we ve been working to ensure our websites are more usable for everyone regardless of which browsers devices and assistive technologies they rely on to reach our goal we ve been making improvements to our design system and we ve been creating new resources and training to inform our practices in this post we ll share what we ve done so far how your experience of browsing our websites might be improved and most importantly we ll talk about the work that s still ahead of us improvements to our design system chorus sites may look dramatically different but each one is powered by a shared set of reusable interface components or design patterns each masthead color palette and page layout is built on reusable bits of design and code since these components are used on every chorus site we partnered with the team at prime access consulting pac to guide our work through shared working sessions and detailed reviews pac has done much more than just audit each pattern in our design system and to help us define the scope of our accessibility efforts they ve helped us broaden our definition of digital design and shown us ways to talk and think more critically about how we work while the work is still very much in progress we wanted to share some specific ways we ve improved our design system which in turn makes every one of our pages more usable auditing our colors for sufficient contrast ryan gantz principal designer our accessibility audit surfaced a number of places where our colors don t have sufficient contrast making them difficult for audiences to read or perceive some of these colors can be fixed in a fairly straightforward way for example many of our story bylines and subtitles used a gray that s much too light we can darken those values globally making them easier to read against a white background similarly some of our networks use a primary brand color that can leave links looking too pale especially against light gray backgrounds on the verge we changed that primary color to a slightly darker pink to remedy the issue other fixes require more work polygon uses shades of pink that are regularly incorporated into gradient overlays resulting in a contrast ratio that s too low for white text set against them for example some networks need further adjustments to their core brand colors which means further exploration and coordination with their teams making changes to a color palette that s already in use isn t always easy but it s our priority to make our design system and the foundations powering it accessible to everyone perhaps most importantly our brand design team has made the same commitment for new color palettes as more publishers come onto chorus we re working closely to develop sites with good contrast ratios from the start adding alternative text for social images nicole zhu full stack engineer images make up important parts of our stories so in addition to supporting alternative text or alt text for images on our own sites and encouraging our editorial staff to write good alt text we ve added support for sending alt text for social images to twitter and facebook when a link is shared on either of these social networks we add optional metadata tags if the social image has alt text twitter image alt for twitter and og image alt for facebook example of apple s voiceover screen reader reading a twitter card from eater containing an image with alt text a better structure for our pages and patterns ethan marcotte front end architect our audiences use a whole host of technologies to browse the web some people visit our sites while using a mouse or trackpad while others may use a keyboard screen reader switch head wand or another assistive technology to navigate our sites some may even use multiple technologies at once for users who navigate by tabbing or by sound we ve introduced a few ways to quickly access the content the first is a skip link placed at the top of each page the link is visually hidden by default but can be accessed by pressing the tab key on your keyboard if you use a screen reader it should be the first item read aloud on each page when you select the link you ll skip right over a site s logo and navigation menus and go right to the heart of the page you re on in the following video a skip to main content link appears at the top of the vox homepage when the tab key is pressed on the keyboard after selecting a link the browser jumps to the page content skipping over the site s masthead we re in the process of making the structure of our pages more understandable to assistive technology and to the people who use it we started introducing sections into our code known as landmarks allowing our users to quickly access different regions of content in the following video the voiceover rotor menu appears over a story on the verge when the menu is active i can navigate directly to the footer by selecting the content information landmark after i can use it to jump to the navigation at the top of the page along with making our layouts more understandable we ve been introducing descriptive labels to our components which can help assistive technology announce a component s purpose when you navigate to it in the following video i m using voiceover to navigate through the headings that appear at the top of eater s homepage as i navigate different key sections are read aloud follow eater online search and eater main menu we ve also started improving how icons and logos are described before a youtube icon might be read aloud as voxdotcom which wouldn t give you a clear indication of what happens when you follow the link doesn t follow vox com on youtube sound much clearer that s why we ve started adding better labels to these images and we d love your feedback as we continue this work improving our teasers ambika castle front end engineer one big challenge we faced in making chorus more accessible was in tackling our most ubiquitous and nested component the teaser teasers were designed to entice you to read stories that are featured on homepages and landing pages teasers include an image headline byline and tags and this combination is one of our most complex components it appears in several places throughout a site appears differently in different contexts and has different accessibility requirements depending on where it appears in our codebase it s a single component and a very complex one at that to make the teaser more accessible we ve gone down the difficult path of refactoring it the changes we re making won t appear overnight but when they re complete they ll make every element on chorus landing pages more accessible to start we ve restructured the teaser so it can use the correct heading tag depending on where it appears the first place we re using this structure is in our two up hero component which promotes two stories an example of the two up hero component as used on the ringer which contains two nested teasers if you visit our sites with a screen reader we ve added a few things that should make this component easier to use first a few non visual headings better describe the purpose of the content you re about to read and if you re accustomed to browsing by heading those extra headings make it easier to find and navigate the teasers we ve also improved this component s markup to be much more accessible for some of our users the teaser component wasn t very usable in fact it was broken because of the way the component was structured the filename of the images were being read aloud as a string of gibberish we ve patched this bug which should make teasers sound a lot better an example of the teaser component as it appears on the ringer s homepage these are fairly modest changes especially after such a large refactor but by refactoring a component that s heavily used across our sites we ve created a foundation we can build on by ensuring the teaser component can be easily customized we re paving the way for more accessibility improvements in the future soon our users will see similar usability improvements on all of our hero components and on the lists of stories below them making our forms more usable nicole zhu full stack engineer we ve made some changes to make forms more accessible and easier to use the first step was redesigning our newsletter signups which appear on homepages landing pages and within the body of stories accessible newsletter design across various chorus sites we added required field indicators both visually and in the html with the required attribute we removed all use of html placeholder attributes and added consistent form field labels for people using assistive technology we ve improved the way newsletter signup forms are described when you navigate to the start of the component the specific newsletter title is announced in a more descriptive way and the legal terms are read aloud before you can submit the form resources and training of course better pages and patterns are only half the work to sustain accessibility practices over time an organization needs to center the needs of the people affected by our design decisions we knew we needed to talk about accessibility differently so we sought out resources and training to help every member of our team do just that we also wanted to hear directly from the people we re designing for here are some of the ways we ve started those conversations internally encouraging continued learning l via labate principal product manager having a shared long term goal and commitment to making accessible websites was a great way to pique and renew everyone s interest in doing this work thoughtfully we ve had an accessibility channel in our prolific slack for a long time but as we embarked on this journey it became abuzz with questions ideas and new enthusiasm we knew that access to current materials was important to create a baseline understanding of people s needs as well as technical solutions to satisfy them vox media offers great financial support for professional development so the many book recommendations were devoured in addition to countless stories videos and research reports we challenged ourselves to increase our literacy of the web content accessibility guidelines as a reference for the scope of changes we needed to prioritize we held a wcag thing i learned challenge leading up to global accessibility awareness day where teammates read a section of the guidelines every day for two weeks and shared a specific insight that helped them better understand the accessibility needs of our audiences and technical solutions to support them this was a great way to get us engrossed in accessibility practices and it generated even more enthusiasm appetite and questions about what it means to make accessible websites learning does not happen on first exposure however creating a strong foundation of understanding was as important to us as making necessary technical updates so we invested in a new full day event called accessibility inclusion a day of learning which was open to the entire organization expert speakers who ve been advocating for these topics for years joined us remotely to share their knowledge and insights we held the event in a livestream making it easy for our fully distributed team to participate we also recorded and captioned the event for future team members to share on that same foundation these sessions helped cement our commitment and expand our framing of accessibility and inclusion including what it means to do this work with the people most affected by it to the different circumstances of use that inform the scenarios we might test for and the myriad design opportunities before us among many others these efforts have helped us establish a shared understanding of purpose context and ethics around this work and set us on a very productive journey of learning that we ll continue to pursue training team members on screen reader basics ethan marcotte front end architect as our team began addressing accessibility issues we knew we needed to get more familiar with different kinds of assistive technology screen readers felt like a good starting point the product team uses macos computers which includes a copy of apple s voiceover screen reader now voiceover is just one screen reader nvda for windows is another very popular and free screen reader and of course screen readers are just one form of assistive technology but for us voiceover felt like a natural helpful starting point we ran two short sessions internally helping our engineers and qa team learn some of the basics how to start and stop the screen reader how to navigate by headings lists or landmark regions and how different kinds of images are read some of our engineers have started posting video or audio recordings of voiceover in their pull requests to demonstrate how their work improves or changes the experience of course as sighted engineers and designers our experiences with screen readers will be dramatically different from those who rely on screen readers for access but becoming more comfortable with voiceover has been an incredible first step for our team documenting our accessibility standards nicole fenton communications manager along with training the product team we developed new curriculum and documentation for our editorial networks to help them meet accessibility standards we started by reviewing a wide sample of stories and videos to understand how teams were using features like subheadings alt text and closed captions we reviewed resources from w c webaim the accessibility project the national center on disability and journalism and more to pull together topic based guidelines around text images videos audio files and podcasts tables motion and color contrast we also audited recent support emails that touch on these topics to add more context to our guidelines we developed videos to demonstrate how screen readers work when reading stories navigating by heading level and announcing various combinations of alt text captions and image credits from chorus throughout the process we worked closely with accessibility experts at pac to ensure the materials were accurate and thorough in may we held a training workshop with managing editors designers and editorial stakeholders to test out the materials and to ask questions about decisions that affect people with disabilities since then our networks have rolled out the training to their teams in smaller individualized sessions and we ve continued to add to our documentation as questions come up the work continues as it always does as a team we think of this post as an update not an announcement because our work s not done far from it we re continuing to refine and improve our internal resources we re still discussing how best to act on the design research we re doing and many of the components in our design system still need fixing and even some of those mentioned here need further improvements to be truly usable but maybe an update s okay after all designing and building for accessibility isn t ever finished digital teams have to constantly ceaselessly strive to improve their practices as l via labate notes trying critiquing using rejecting and adopting the right tools and processes is real work and an ongoing effort for the team in other words we have to ensure we re always delivering the most accessible work successful accessibility work can t be measured in sprints launch dates or deadlines after all our users help us shape the direction of our products and we ll always be adapting our practices to meet their needs as we said above we ve identified many many fixes we re planning to make but as we learn more about our users and listen to our users we ll improve on our old approaches and design more accessible solutions that better meet their needs we re in the process of making significant improvements to our platform which will allow our team and in time our customers to quickly and easily update the design of chorus powered websites the future is bright and it s going to be a lot more accessible too the

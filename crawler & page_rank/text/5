one to support our nonprofit environmental journalism please consider disabling your ad blocker to allow ads on grist here s how despite broad bipartisan public support for protecting public lands these shared landscapes have come under relentless attack during the first days of president donald trump s second term the administration and its allies in congress are working feverishly to tilt the scale away from natural resource protection and toward extraction threatening a pillar of the nation s identity and tradition of democratic governance there s no larger concentration of unappropriated wealth on this globe than exists in this country on our public lands said jesse deubel executive director of the new mexico wildlife federation a conservation nonprofit the fact that there are interests that would like to monetize that they d like to liquidate it and turn it into cash money is no surprise more on trump s first days a siege on science how trump is undoing an american legacy why trump can t stop states from fighting climate change trump is bypassing community input to fast track energy projects that risk pollution landscape protections and bedrock conservation laws are on the chopping block as trump and his team look to boost and fast track drilling mining and logging across the federal estate the administration and the gop controlled congress are eyeing selling off federal lands both for housing development and to help offset trump s tax and spending cuts and the newly formed department of government efficiency or doge led by billionaire elon musk is wreaking havoc within federal land management agencies pushing out thousands of civil servants that purge will leave america s natural heritage more vulnerable to the myriad threats these lands already face including growing visitor numbers climate change wildfires and invasive species the republican campaign to undermine land management agencies and wrest control of public lands from the federal government is nothing new dating back to the sagebrush rebellion movement of the s and s when support for privatizing or transferring federal lands to state control exploded across the west but the speed and scope of the current attack along with its disregard for the public s support for safeguarding public lands makes it more worrisome than previous iterations several public land advocates and legal experts told grist grist thanks its sponsors become one to support our nonprofit environmental journalism please consider disabling your ad blocker to allow ads on grist here s how this is probably the most significant moment since the reagan administration in terms of privatization said steven davis a political science professor at edgewood college and the author of the book in defense of public lands the case against privatization and transfer president ronald reagan was a self proclaimed sagebrush rebel a national park service ranger wears a patch as she conducts a walking tour in everglades national park florida on april the trump administration s doge program has fired hundreds of park rangers across the united states joe raedle getty images deubel said the conservation community knew trump s return would trigger another drawn out fight for the future of public lands but nothing could have prepared him for this level of chaos particularly the effort to rid agencies of thousands of staffers the country is in a much more pro public lands position than we ve been before deubel said but i think we re at greater risk than we ve ever been before not because the time is right in the eyes of the american people but because we have an administration who could give two shits about what the american people want that s what s got me scared the interior department and the white house did not respond to grist s requests for comment in an article posted to the white house website on earth day the trump administration touted several key actions it has taken on the environment including protecting public lands by opening more acres to energy development protecting wildlife by pausing wind energy projects and safeguarding forests by expanding logging the accomplishments list received widespread condemnation from environmental climate and public land advocacy groups that same day a leaked draft strategic plan revealed the interior department s four year vision for opening new federal lands to drilling and other extractive development reducing the amount of federal land it manages by selling some for housing development and transferring other acres to state control rolling back the boundaries of protected national monuments and weakening bedrock environmental laws like the endangered species act an aerial view of gas and oil drilling pads in the plateau creek drainage near debeque colorado where the bureau of land management sold leases in and helen h richardson the denver post via getty images meanwhile trump s doge is in the process of cutting thousands of scientists and other staff from the various agencies that manage and protect public lands including the national park service and the bureau of land management or blm nearly every republican senator went on the record this month in support of selling off federal lands to reduce the federal deficit voting down a measure that would have blocked such sales and utah has promised to continue its legal fight aimed at stripping more than million acres of blm lands within the state s border from the federal government utah s lawsuit which the supreme court declined to hear in january had the support of numerous republican led states including north dakota while current interior secretary doug burgum was still governor to advance its agenda the trump administration is citing a series of emergencies that close observers say are at best exaggerated and at worst manufactured a purported energy emergency which trump declared in an executive order just hours after being inaugurated has been the impetus for the administration attempting to throw long standing federal permitting processes public comment periods and environmental safeguards to the wind the action aims to boost fossil fuel extraction across federal lands and waters despite domestic oil and gas production being at record highs while simultaneously working to thwart renewable energy projects trump relied on that same emergency earlier this month when he ordered federal agencies to prop up america s dwindling polluting coal industry which the president and his cabinet have insisted is beautiful and clean in reality coal is among the most polluting forms of energy this whole idea of an emergency is ridiculous said mark squillace a professor of natural resources law at the university of colorado boulder and now this push to reinvigorate the coal industry seems absolutely crazy to me why would you try to reinvigorate a moribund industry that has been declining for the last decade or more makes no sense it s not going to happen coal consumption in the u s has declined more than percent since peaking in according to the u s energy information administration largely due to market forces including the availability of cheaper natural gas and america s growing renewable energy sector meanwhile trump s tariff war threatens to undermine his own push to expand mining and fossil fuel drilling interior secretary doug burgum second from left looks on as president donald trump signs executive orders about boosting coal production on april jabin botsford the washington post via getty images the threat of extreme wildfire an actual crisis driven by a complex set of factors including climate change its role in intensifying droughts and pest outbreaks and decades of fire suppression is being cited to justify slashing environmental reviews to ramp up logging on public lands following up on a trump executive order to increase domestic timber production secretary of agriculture brooke rollins signed a memo declaring a forest health emergency that would open nearly percent of national forest lands more than million acres to aggressive logging then there s america s housing affordability crisis which the trump administration dozens of republicans and even a handful of democrats are pointing to in a growing push to open federal lands to housing development either by selling land to private interests or transferring control to states the trump administration recently established a task force to identify what it calls underutilized lands in an op ed announcing that effort burgum and scott turner secretary of housing and urban development wrote that much of the million acres interior oversees is suitable for residential use some of the most high profile members of the anti public lands movement including william perry pendley who served as acting director of the bureau of land management during trump s first term are championing the idea read next public lands private profits inside the trump plan to offload federal land lois parshley without guardrails critics argue the sale of public lands to build housing will lead to sprawl in remote sensitive landscapes and do little if anything to address home affordability as the issue is driven by several factors including migration trends stagnant wages and higher construction costs notably trump s tariff policies are expected to raise the average price of a new home by nearly chris hill ceo of the conservation lands foundation a colorado based nonprofit working to protect blm managed lands said the lack of affordable housing is a serious issue but we shouldn t be fooled that the idea to sell off public lands is a solution the vast majority of public lands are just not suitable for any sort of housing development due to their remote locations lack of access and necessary infrastructure she said a slot canyon cuts through the western portion of one of the country s newest national monuments chuckwalla mountains near chiriaco summit california president trump rescinded the area s monument status on march david mcnew getty images david hayes who served as deputy interior secretary during the administrations of barack obama and bill clinton and as a senior climate adviser to president joe biden told grist that trump s broad use of executive power sets the current privatization push apart from previous efforts not only do you have the rhetoric and the intentionality around managing public lands in an aggressive way but you have to couple that with what you re seeing he said this administration is going farther than any other ever has to push the limits of executive power aaron weiss deputy director of the center for western priorities a colorado based conservation group said trump and his team are doing everything they can to circumvent normal environmental rules and safeguards in order to advance their agenda with no regard for the law or public opinion everything is an imagined crisis weiss said oil gas and coal jobs mining jobs timber jobs farming and ranching gas powered cars and kitchen appliances even the water pressure in your shower ask the white house and the republican party and they ll tell you biden waged a war against all of it and that voters gave trump a mandate to reverse course during trump s first term in office interior secretary ryan zinke repeatedly boasted that the administration s conservation legacy would rival that of his personal hero and america s conservationist president theodore roosevelt only to have the late president s great grandson theodore roosevelt iv and the conservation community bemoan his record at the helm of the massive federal agency like zinke burgum invoked roosevelt in pitching himself for the job interior secretary doug burgum tours a fracking site in washington county pennsylvania on april where he discussed president trump s recent executive orders to boost domestic fossil fuel production department of the interior in our time president donald trump s energy dominance agenda can be america s big stick that will be leveraged to achieve historic prosperity and world peace burgum said during his confirmation hearing in january referencing a letter in which the th president said to speak softly and carry a big stick the senate confirmed him to the post in january on a bipartisan vote some public land advocates initially viewed burgum now the chief steward of the federal lands waters and wildlife we all own as a palatable nominee in a sea of problematic potential picks a billionaire software entrepreneur and former north dakota governor burgum has talked at length about his fondness for roosevelt s conservation legacy and the outdoors get in touch

whatever honeymoon there was didn t last long one hundred days in burgum and the rest of trump s team have taken not a stick but a wrecking ball to america s public lands waters and wildlife earlier this month the new ceo of rei said the outdoor retailer made a mistake in endorsing burgum for the job and that the administration s actions on public lands are completely at odds with the longstanding values of rei at an april all hands meeting of interior employees burgum showed off pictures of himself touring oil and gas facilities celebrated clean coal and condemned burdensome government regulation burgum has repeatedly described federal lands as america s balance sheet assets that he estimates could be worth trillion but that he argues americans are getting a low return on on the world s largest balance sheet last year the revenue that we pulled in was about billion he said at the staffwide meeting referring to money the government brings from lease fees and royalties from grazing drilling and logging on federal lands as well as national park entrance fees eighteen billion might seem like a big number it s not a big number if we re managing trillion in assets boats dock at antelope point marina on lake powell near page arizona in public lands are the foundation of a trillion outdoor recreation economy in the u s david mcnew getty images in focusing solely on revenues generated from energy and other resource extraction burgum disregards that public lands are the foundation of a trillion outdoor recreation economy nevermind the numerous climate environmental cultural and public health benefits davis the author of in defense of public lands the case against privatization and transfer dismissed burgum s balance sheet argument as shriveled and wrong you have to willfully be ignorant and ignore everything of value about those lands except their marketable commodity value to come up with that conclusion he said when you add all their myriad values together public lands are the biggest bargain you can possibly imagine davis likes to compare public lands to libraries schools or the department of defense there are certain things we as a society decide are important and we pay for it he said we call that public goods the last time conservatives ventured down the public land privatization path it didn t go well shortly after trump s first inauguration in then congressman jason chaffetz a republican representing utah introduced legislation to sell off million acres of public land in western states that he said had been deemed to serve no purpose for taxpayers public backlash was fierce chaffetz pulled the bill just two weeks later citing concerns from his constituents the episode while brief largely forced the anti federal land movement back into the shadows the first trump administration continued to weaken safeguards for million acres of federal lands more than any other administration in history and offered up millions more for oil and gas development but stopped short of trying sell off or transfer large areas of the public domain demonstrators protest federal workforce layoffs at muir woods national monument in marin county california on march santiago mejia san francisco chronicle via getty images yet as the last few months have shown the anti public lands movement is alive and well public land advocates are hopeful that the current push will flounder they expect courts to strike down many of trump s environmental rollbacks as they did during his first term in recent weeks crowds have rallied at numerous national parks and state capitol buildings to support keeping public lands in public hands democratic senator martin heinrich of new mexico who voted to confirm burgum to his post and serves as the ranking democrat on the senate energy and natural resources committee has taken to social media to warn about the growing republican effort to undermine transfer and sell off public lands i continue to be encouraged that people are going to be loud they already are said deubel the executive director of the new mexico wildlife federation we re mobilizing we ve got business and industries we ve got republicans we ve got democrats we ve got hunters and we ve got non hunters we ve got everybody speaking out about this in a time of extreme polarization on seemingly every issue public lands enjoy broad bipartisan support the th annual conservation in the west poll found that percent of voters in eight western states support public lands conservation over increased energy development the highest level of support in the poll s history percent oppose giving states control over federal public lands up from percent in and percent oppose shrinking or removing protections for national monuments up from percent in even in utah where leaders have spent millions of taxpayer dollars promoting the state s anti federal lands lawsuit support for protecting public lands remains high protesters rally outside yosemite valley welcome center on march during a national day of action against the trump administration s mass firing of national park service employees stephen lam san francisco chronicle via getty images even in all these made up crises the american public doesn t want this hill said the american people want and love their public lands at his recent staffwide meeting burgum said roosevelt s legacy should guide interior staff in the mission to manage and protect federal public lands those two things management and protection must be held in balance burgum stressed yet in social media posts and friendly interviews with conservative media burgum has left little doubt about where his priorities lie repeatedly rolling out what breitbart dubbed the four babies of trump s energy dominance agenda drill baby drill map baby map mine baby mine build baby build protect baby protect conserve baby conserve and steward baby steward have yet to
